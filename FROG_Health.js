 * A Health system to track various levels of health beyond physical damage.
 * Author Frogboy
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * RPG Maker MV gives you a lot of fine-grained control over your game, but
 * it’s primarily geared towards the creation of the JRPGs.  This means that
 * certain aspects of some of the classic WRPGs that I grew up with, like
 * Ultima and Dungeons & Dragons, aren’t supported by default.  Well, I’d like
 * to fix that!
 *
 * Adventuring is dangerous business.  Imagine your party climbing the tallest
 * mountain in the world.  The icy wind howls as you all attempt to stave off
 * the cold.  Nights are treacherous and not just because monsters are about.
 * The temperature drops to an unmanageable degree.  You must find shelter and
 * build a fire in order to avoid freezing to death.  You packed as much food
 * and water as you could but reaching the top of the mountain is taking a lot
 * longer than anyone expected.  The monsters roaming this rarely travelled
 * location are fierce and relentless.  Exhaustion is setting in as sleep is
 * hard to come by.  Will you live to reach the peak?  Will you have enough
 * strength left to fight the White Dragon who lives at the top and guards an
 * ancient artifact that you desperately need to fulfill your quest?
 *
 * One element that used to be very common in classic WRPGs is extra parameters
 * for health beyond the physical which is typically designated as HP or Life.
 * These extra parameters are typically things that a real, living human being,
 * or whatever race they may be, couldn’t survive or function without: Food,
 * Water, Oxygen, Normal Body Temperature, their Mind/Psyche/Sanity and so on.
 * Some games even divided a character’s overall HP into different body parts
 * with varying side-effects attributed to low health in each.  A busted leg
 * would slow you down.  A mangled arm would make it impossible to carry a
 * shield.  A serious head wound might knock you out for while.
 *
 * That’s where FROG_Health comes into play, or at least it will when it’s
 * finished.  Support is limited to simple things like Hunger, Thirst and
 * Exhaustion but I have plans to add the rest and maybe more.  That’s where
 * you come in.  I’d like to know what you would use a plugin like this for so
 * that I make sure that it is supported.  Let me know and I’ll do my best to
 * add it.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * How to Use
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin has a crap-ton of parameters so that you can configure this
 * system work however you need for your game.  Ready to get crunchy?
 *
 * Health Config - Add various aspects of health to your game.  This is the meat
 * and potatoes of this plugin.  This parameter allows you to add additional HP
 * stats to your game.  Maybe you want to make Food, Water and Rest.  A horror
 * game could utilize Sanity or Fear.  Maybe you want to have a system where
 * Head, Body, Arms and Legs each have their own HP bars.  It’s completely
 * customizable so whatever you want to do will probably work.
 *
 *     Name - The name of this aspect of health.
 *
 *     Description - General description about this aspect of health.
 *
 *     Abbreviation - The key that you’ll use to identify this aspect of health
 *     in script calls, plugin commands and even in formula boxes if you wish.
 *
 *     Max Health - Number representing this aspects full health value.
 *
 *     Control - Controls how the value is applied.
 *         Decremental - Health value decreases over time.
 *         Equilibrium - Health value rises or falls until it reaches the
 *         midpoint.
 *         Incremental - Health value increases over time.
 *
 *     Every X Steps - How often the Auto-Adjust value is applied based on
 *     steps taken.
 *
 *     Value - The health value will rise or fall by this based on the Control
 *     parameter.
 *
 *     State Management - Low health in different areas apply States to a
 *     character.  You can define how that works here by specifying the
 *     range of HP that the State will be automatically applied and the
 *     likelihood it will happen.  Imagine that you have a Rest health
 *     attribute.  If a character’s Rest falls below 40%, you could apply a
 *     Tired state which maybe reduces their hit accuracy a little.  At 15%,
 *     maybe you replace the Tired state with Exhausted which also lowers
 *     their Attack as well.  If it gets all the way down to 0, they could
 *     fall asleep.
 *
 *         Description - Label to let you know what this entry is doing.  Not
 *         required but recommended.
 *
 *         State Id - The State that is applied or removed depending whether the
 *         actor’s health score falls within the Min and Max HP.
 *
 *         Type - Indicates whether Min HP and Max HP represent exact values or
 *         percentage of max health HP.

 *             Explicit Value - Min and Max HP are used as exact values.  If Max
 *             HP is 30, the State will apply at exactly 30 HP even if the
 *             actor’s maximum Health HP is 200.
 *
 *             Percentage - This uses the percentage of an actor’s maximum
 *             Health HP.  If Max HP is set to 30 and their maximum Health
 *             HP is 200, the State will apply at 60 HP.
 *
 *         Min HP - The minimum Health HP that this State will be applied.
 *
 *         Max HP - The maximum Health HP that this State will be applied.
 *
 *         Add Percentage - Odds per step that this State will be applied to any
 *         actor that falls within the min/max range.
 *
 *         Remove Percentage - Odds per step that this State will be removed for
 *         any actor that falls outside of the min/max range.
 *
 *         Adjustments - Different actors, classes, races, states, equipment and
 *         items can affect how State Management functions.  A Sea Elf may be
 *         able to hold their breath three times as long as a human underwater.
 *         Flame Armor can help you withstand extreme heat.  Paladins have
 *         extraordinary willpower.  All of these work mostly the same.  They
 *         just apply to different aspects of the game.
 *
 *             Description - Description so you know what this entry is.
 *             Recommended but not required.
 *
 *             Id - The actor, class, race, state, item, weapon or armor that
 *             adjusts the default health State Management values.
 *
 *             Value - The default Value will be adjusted by this amount.
 *
 *             Steps - The default Every X Steps will be adjusted by this
 *             amount.
 *
 *             Add Percentage - The default Add Percentage will be adjusted by
 *             this percent.  This value is multiplied by the State Management’s
 *
 *             Add Percentage as well as all other adjustments.  100% means that
 *             it stays the same.  50% mean that it cuts it in half and 200%
 *             would double the odds.  This works like applying multiple
 *             Elemental Chance traits.
 *
 *             Remove Percentage - Works just like Add Percent but applies to
 *             the Remove Percentage chance.
 *
 *             Visible - Actors, class and races can be configured to hide this
 *             Health HP attribute so that this character doesn’t appear to have
 *             it at all.  Make sure you set Immune to false if if you want to
 *             completely eliminate this Health attribute for this character.
 *
 *             Enemy Parameters - If your actors have to deal with various
 *             levels of Health, their foes should need to as well.  Enemies
 *             don’t typically persist beyond battle so this parameter just
 *             allows you to set the default Min and Max percentage range for
 *             all enemies.  If this is not set, the range will default to the
 *             optimum 50% range according to the gauges Control.  A Decremental
 *             gauge will be 50%-100%; an Incremental will be 0%-50%; and
 *             Equilibrium defaults to 25%-75%. These defaults can be overridden
 *             here.
 *
 *                 Min Percent -  Minimum percentage of Health HP enemies start
 *                 battle with.
 *
 *                 Max Percent -  Maximum percentage of Health HP enemies start
 *                 battle with.
 *
 *         Show in Battle Log - Show or hide damage to this Health in the
 *         Battle Log.
 *
 *         Recover All - Health HP recovers to optimum value when Recover All
 *         command is executed.
 *
 *         Battle Gauge Color - Customize the battle gauge color.
 *
 *         Drain Health Abbr - Normally, when a Health HP bar runs out, that’s
 *         it.  Most of the time, something really bad happens like they die,
 *         fall asleep, go insane or whatever.  But maybe you don’t want it to
 *         be so drastic.  Maybe running out food or water doesn’t kill you but
 *         starts draining your normal HP.  In systems where normal HP is split
 *         into different Health HP stats like (Head, Body, Arms and Legs), you
 *         probably want negative health in those areas to start damaging the
 *         character’s normal HP.  By specifying an abbreviation, when this
 *         Health is at critical levels as defined by the Control parameter,
 *         excess is applied to the other Health stat.  You can also use HP or
 *         MP here.
 *
 * Basic State Management - Wouldn’t it be nice if have low HP, MP or TP could
 * also apply States like Health HP does?  Wouldn’t it be nice we even went a
 * step farther and granted a nice little bonus when these attributes are nearly
 * full?  Of course it would so that why you can now extend this kind of
 * functionality to your normal HP stats.
 *
 *     HP State Management - Configured just like State Management but for
 *     normal HP.
 *
 *     MP State Management - Configured just like State Management but for MP.
 *
 *     TP State Management - Configured just like State Management but for TP.
 *     Not sure how useful this one is but it’s here anyway.
 *
 * Conditions - Add conditions that alter the way specific Health aspects
 * function for all party members.  Many different environments can change the
 * way Health HP work.  Going underwater will deplete your Oxygen.  An icy
 * tundra could freeze an unprepared adventurer to death.  Travelling through a
 * desert can give you heat stroke and drain your Water HP quicker.  A stale
 * bog might have a chance to infect you with a rare disease.  No longer can
 * your adventurers brave harsh conditions without feeling it’s effects.  Some
 * Conditions may not affect Health at all but are just used to turn day into
 * night or make ranged attacks less effective if it happens to be especially
 * windy outside.
 *
 *     Name - Name of the Condition.
 *
 *     Description - Description of the Condition.
 *
 *     Icon Id - In the top right-hand corner of the default Status Window, this
 *     icon will show when this Condition is active.
 *
 *     Adjust Health - Conditions change the way Health HP normally functions.
 *     Some Health aspects, like Food and Water, naturally deplete over time.
 *     Others, like Oxygen, are naturally available.  Conditions change this.
 *     Getting sealed in an airtight room will deprive you of Oxygen.  Cold
 *     weather will lower your Body Temperature.  You could even have it so that
 *     just hanging out at the tavern raise your Water HP.
 *
 *         Health Abbr - Abbreviation for the aspect of Health that is affected.
 *
 *         Control - Resets the ways that the gauge operates.  Normally, Oxygen
 *         would increment over time and usually be maxed out but if the party
 *         went underwater, their Oxygen would start decreasing instead.
 *
 *         Adjust Value - Adds to the default Health Value.
 *
 *         Adjust Steps - Adds to the default Every X Steps.
 *
 *         Immune - Disables Health adjustments when true.
 *
 *     Set Common Event - Common Event that will run when this Condition becomes
 *     active.  Say you have a Night condition.  You could tint the screen dark.
 *     A Cold condition may have a chance to make it start snowing.  Perhaps you
 *     need remove other conditions when this one becomes active.
 *
 *     Remove Common Event - Same as the Add version but triggers when this
 *     Condition is removed.
 *
 *     Immune - Actors, classes, races, items, equipment and states that make
 *     one immune to this condition are defined here.
 *
 * Formula Config - By now, you might be wondering how these Health attributes
 * work in battle.  For the most part, they work just like normal HP.  This
 * changes some dynamics, though.  If you have Rest HP, why have a Sleep spell
 * that succeeds or fails based on random chance?  You could make Sleep do Rest
 * damage now.  Charm and Fascination could attack the mind.  You could even
 * have a suffocation spell suck the air out your enemy’s lungs (assuming they
 * have lungs).  Your Skill list is about to get a lot more interesting.
 *
 *     Name - The name of this formula.  The editor doesn’t have any way to
 *     handle a Skill that does damage to HP, Food and Water.  So to make this
 *     possible, you can now enter the name of a formula here and place that
 *     name within quotes in the formula box of a Skill or Item.  If you enter
 *     ‘quake’ or “quake” into the formula box (with the quotes), the Skill or
 *     Item will reference the formula with the name quake.
 *
 *     Damage - Define however many damage formulas you need and which aspects
 *     of Health are affected.  Use hp, mp or tp if you want to affect these
 *     attributes.
 *
 *         Health Abbr - The Health abbreviation this formula applies to.  Use
 *         hp or mp to affect those types.  If you want this formula to
 *         affect a random type of Health, list all of the abbreviations
 *         seperated by commas.  For instance, if your Health Abbr. is *head,
 *         body, arms, legs*, the plugin will randomly pick one of the four.
 *         You can even list an abbreviation multiple times to shift the odds.
 *         Say you did *hp, hp, hp, psyche*.  There would be a 75% chance that
 *         HP would be affected and a 25% that Psyche would get damaged.
 *
 *         Formula - Enter the formula just as you would in the normal formula
 *         box except now you get a nice big, multi-line note box.  How freakin’
 *         sweet is that?
 *
 *         Show Damage - Damage is shown in battle log and visibly affects the
 *         target.  Sometimes, you may not want to show every different type of
 *         damage during an attack.  Maybe getting hit with an attack wakes you
 *         up a little and adds a small amount to your Rest HP.  For something
 *         minor like this, you probably don’t need to display this information.
 *         Turn this off in those situations.
 *
 *         Flip Damage - If the damage type is set to HP Damage, it flips to HP
 *         Recovery for this Health attribute.  HP Recovery becomes HP Damage.
 *         Sometimes you may need to damage some health while recovering one or
 *         more others (or vise versa).
 *
 *         Min 1 Damage - This formula will always do at least 1 damage.
 *
 *     Register as Damage - This Skill counts as a hit and will activate a
 *     State's Remove by Damage property.  A Sleep skill that wakes up its
 *     target isn’t of much use so you should turn this off in situations like
 *     this.
 *
 * Actor Config - Configure actor specific properties.
 *
 *     Description - Description so you know what this entry is. Recommended but
 *     not required.
 *
 *     Actor Id - The actor these properties apply to.
 *
 *     Custom Terms - Change the names for HP, MP and/or TP for this actor.
 *     Sometimes, these terms just don’t fit for everyone, especially MP.
 *         HP Name - Change the term HP for this actor.
 *         HP Abbr - Change the term HP (abbr.) for this actor.
 *         MP Name - Change the term HP for this actor.
 *         MP Abbr - Change the term HP (abbr.) for this actor.
 *         TP Name - Change the term HP for this actor.
 *         TP Abbr - Change the term HP (abbr.) for this actor.
 *
 * Class Config - You said that these were just like real HP.  That means that
 * my characters can gain Health HP as they level up, right?  Yep, of course
 * they can.
 *
 *     Description - Description so you know what this entry is. Recommended
 *     but not required.
 *
 *     Class Id - The class these properties apply to.
 *
 *     Custom Terms - Change the names for HP, MP and/or TP for this class.
 *
 *     Level Up - Configure how Health HP increases on level up.
 *
 *         Health Abbr - The Health abbreviation.  You know the drill by now.
 *
 *         Starting Max HP - Use this to overwrite the default Max HP. Leave at
 *         0 to use the default as defined in Health Config.
 *
 *         Lower Level Gain - Each level, an actor with this class will gain at
 *         least this amount of additional Health HP.
 *
 *         Upper Level Gain - Each level, an actor with this class will gain no
 *         more than this amount of additional Health HP.
 *
 * Enemy Config - Configure enemy specific properties.
 *
 *     Description - Description so you know what this entry is. Recommended but
 *     not required.
 *
 *     Enemy Id - The enemy these properties apply to.
 *
 *     Custom Terms - Change the names for HP, MP and/or TP for this enemy.
 *
 * Use Health Battle Status - The actor battle status window has been reimagined
 * to display all of your Health HP gauges.  If you don’t want to use this, set
 * this to false.
 *
 * Use Custom Terms - Custom Actor Terms for HP, MP and TP require
 * overwriting core code so this option must be explicitly enabled to use.
 * Overwriting core code can cause incompatibilities with other plugins so I’m
 * giving you way to shut this off if you need to.
 *
 * Add to Formulas - If you want to use any of the actor’s Health HP in a
 * formula, turn this option on.  If not, you can leave it off.
 *
 * Save Health Object - Setting this to true allows you to modify the
 * $dataHealth object, which contains all of the information within the plugin
 * parameters, when the player saves the game.  By default, this object is built
 * from the plugin parameters when a new game is started or a saved game is
 * loaded.  This is usually what you’ll want.  If, for some reason, you need to
 * alter this data in-game and have those changes persist until the end of the
 * game, you’ll need to turn this option on.
 *
 * Limit Party Size - Health effects will only be applied to the first X members
 * of the party.  This option is mainly used for games that only want the lead
 * actor to have to manage their health while other actors are temporary
 * characters that are assumed to be managing their own health.  It can also be
 * used if you have reserve actors and you don’t want their health levels
 * falling.
 *
 *
 * Style
 *
 * Show Max Health - The default Status screen now shows the different levels of
 * health alongside the actor’s attributes and equipment.  The Health HP is
 * shown as Current HP/Max HP.  If you only want to show the current HP, turn
 * this off.
 *
 * Color Config - The default Status screen’s attributes and Health HP now
 * display with color gauges.  You can configure those gauges here.
 *
 *     Attributes - Colors for Attribute gauges.
 *         Min Percent - Minimum percentage for this color.
 *         Max Percent - Maximum percentage for this color.
 *         Start Color - Hex color that this type of gauge starts with on the
 *         left.
 *         End Color - Hex color that this type of gauge ends with on the right.
 *     Decremental - Define the colors for Decremental Health gauges.
 *     Equilibrium - Define the colors for Equilibrium Health gauges.
 *     Incremental - Define the colors for Incremental Health gauges.
 *
 * Battle Config - Health HP has been integrated with the battle system.
 * Because actors and enemies can now have many different HPs to take into
 * consideration, I implemented visual gauges to more easily present this
 * information to your players.
 *
 *     Use Enemy HP Gauge - Enable or disable Health HP Gauges in battle.
 *
 *     Use Damage Popup - Normally, HP damage pops up when damage is done.  If
 *     you are using the visual gauges, you probably want to suppress the
 *     default behavior.  But if you still want the normal HP damage numbers to
 *     popup, you can turn this on.
 *
 *     Enemy Gauge Width - Set the width of enemies visual Health gauges.
 *
 *     Enemy Gauge List - Global list of enemy gauges to display during battle.
 *     Any abbreviations left off this list won't show in battle and enemies
 *     will be immune to damage of this type. You can remove Health HP from
 *     every enemy by not listing it here.
 *
 *     Battle Status Config - If you’ve enabled Use Health Battle Status then
 *     the default actor battle status window will replaced with one more
 *     suitable.  This is where you can configure how this looks.  Every game is
 *     different and there’s no telling how many Health attributes you are using
 *     in your game and which ones are relevant in battle.
 *
 *         Actor Face Height - Height in pixels for the actor’s face image.
 *
 *         Gauge Rows - Number of rows for Health gauges.
 *
 *         Gauge Cols - Number of columns for Health gauges.
 *
 *         Name Left Padding - Adjust the padding on the left for the HP text.
 *
 *         Value Right Padding - Adjust the padding on the right for the HP
 *         value.
 *
 *         Top Padding - Adjust the padding on the top if you need to push the
 *         text down some.
 *
 *         Font Size - Font size for battle gauge text.
 *
 *         Gauges - Configure the gauges in the default Battle Status Window.
 *         They will appear in the order that they are listed.
 *
 *             Health Abbr - The Health abbreviation.
 *
 *             Columns - Number of columns that this Health gauge takes up.
 *
 *             Show Name - Show the health abbreviation on the battle gauge.
 *
 *             Show Value - Show the health value on the battle gauge.
 *
 *         Draw Rate - Draw actor battle status window every X frames.  If you
 *         have a lot of gauges and text to draw, it's best to skip a few frames
 *         to ensure that everything runs fast.
 *
 * Status Window - The default RPG Maker MV status window can be configured to
 * show the Health information.
 *
 *     Display Race - Nickname is replaced with Race if FROG Race is installed.
 *
 *     Column 1 - Choose what is displayed in the first column.
 *         Attributes - Display the actor’s attributes like Attack, Defense etc.
 *         Equipment - Display the actor’s equipment.
 *         Health Stats - Display the actor’s Health stats.
 *
 *     Health Stats 1 - If Health Stats chosen, list them in display order.
 *
 *     Column 2 - Choose what is displayed in the second column.
 *
 *     Health Stats 2 - If Health Stats chosen, list them in display order.
 *
 *     Column 3 - Choose what is displayed in the third column.
 *
 *     Health Stats 3 - If Health Stats chosen, list them in display order.
 *
 * Text Manager - Configure how some of the text is displayed, mostly related
 * to the battle log.
 *
 *     Actor Health Damage - Sets the text format for Actor Health Damage.
 *     1 = Actor Name, 2 = Damage, 3 = Damage Type.
 *
 *     Actor Health Drain - Sets the text format for Actor Health Damage.
 *     1 = Actor Name, 2 = Drain, 3 = Damage Type.
 *
 *     Actor Health Recovery - Sets the text format for Actor Health Drain.
 *     1 = Actor Name, 2 = Recovery, 3 = Damage Type.
 *
 *     Enemy Health Damage - Sets the text format for Enemy Health Recovery.
 *     1 = Actor Name, 2 = Damage, 3 = Damage Type.
 *
 *     Enemy Health Drain - Sets the text format for Enemy Health Drain.
 *     1 = Actor Name, 2 = Drain, 3 = Damage Type.
